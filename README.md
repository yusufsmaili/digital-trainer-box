# Digital Trainer Box

This project showcases my hands-on work building and configuring a digital trainer box as part of my coursework at New York City College of Technology. The project involved understanding basic digital electronics, wiring integrated components, soldering, and using a wide variety of tools and electrical parts.

Everything in this repository reflects the build process, tools used, diagrams referenced, and documentation from the course.
